# Passport test repo
## Purpose
Previously when using passport for authentication I have used a starter repo with passport already set up. This didn't feel great so I made this to go through the process and get a feel for what's going on.
## Pre-requisites
To run this locally, you must have Node.js and `npm` or `yarn` installed.
## Setup
1. Download, fork, or clone this repo, navigate to the repo directory, and run either `yarn install` or `npm install`.
2. To start the application, type `yarn start` or `npm start`.
3. Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) or [127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
4. That's it!
